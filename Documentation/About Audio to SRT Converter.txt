# Audio to SRT Converter

This repository contains a Python script for converting audio files into SubRip Subtitle (SRT) format using OpenAI's Whisper model. The script is equipped with a simple and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), allowing easy operation without the need for command-line interaction.

## Features
- **Easy-to-use GUI**: Select audio files and save SRT files using a straightforward interface.
- **Whisper Model Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate audio transcription.
- **Local Processing**: All transcriptions are processed locally for privacy.
- **Multithreaded Performance**: The GUI remains responsive during transcription by using separate threads for processing.
- **Wide Audio Format Support**: Supports various audio file formats such as MP3, WAV, and M4A.
- **Customizable Model Selection**: Choose from different Whisper model sizes to balance between performance and accuracy.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tkinter
- Whisper

Python and Tkinter usually come bundled together. Whisper can be installed using pip.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Whisper
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```
Note: On macOS, if you face issues, you might need Homebrew to install the Tkinter separately using `brew install python-tk`. Homebrew can be installed from [Homebrew's website](https://brew.sh/).

## Usage
Run the script using Python from the terminal (Mac) or command prompt/powershell (Windows):
```sh
python audio_to_srt_converter.py
```
Replace `audio_to_srt_converter.py` with the actual path to the script if you're in a different directory.

1. Use the **Browse** button to select the audio file you wish to transcribe.
2. Choose the save location and name for the SRT file using the **Save As** button.
3. Select the desired Whisper model size from the dropdown menu.
4. Click **Process** to start converting the audio to SRT format.
5. Once processing is done, the SRT file will be saved at your specified location.
